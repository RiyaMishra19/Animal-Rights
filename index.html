  <h1>The benefits of A Vegan Lifestyle </h1>
  <h2> What is Veganism? </h2>
  <p> Veganism is a lifetyle where people try to prevent the exploitation of animals for food, clothing, entertainment and other needs. </p>
  <h2> Why should people go vegan? </h2>
  <p> Although there is a lot of controversy about the topic, a vegan lifestyle is healthy and ideal for people. It includes several benefits such as health, the environment and it also helps improve the lives of animals who are killed for a human's consumption.</p>
  <h3> For the health </h3>
  <p>Contrary to popular belief, a vegan lifestyle is not only sustainable, but also beneficial to our health. According to the American Academy of Nutrition and the British Dietic Association, a well-planned vegan diet is recognized to be healthy for all ages. It also reduces cholestrol intake, chances of heart disease, obesity and diabetes. </p>
  <h3> For the Environment </h3>
  <p>Going vegan can have a large impact on the environment. Everything which is required for the production of meat is harmful to the environment, including the transport, food, crops and water required to feed the animals. A person can take upto as many as 30 showers with the amount of water that is required to produce one hamburger. The grain needed for livestock in the meat industry is a large factor of deforestation, habitat loss and even extinction. 5.6 million acres of land in Brazil alone are used for animal agriculture. </p>
  <h3> For ethical reasons </h3>
<p> A large reason why people choose to transition to veganism is for ethical reasons. Purchasing any animal product leads to the exploitation of innocent animals. in the meat industry, animals are confined in small living quarters where they have barely any space to move around. They often have to stand in their own feces, which may lead to several diseases that spread among the animals. in order for companies to make a profit, the animals are injected with artificial chemicals which makes them grow at abnormal rates in a very short period of time. The legs of chickens are often too frail and weak and buckle under the weight of their bodies. Soon after birth, animals are shipped to slaughterhouses. They are crammed in vehicles and travel for long periods of time without any food, water or rest. Then, they are dehorned and debeaked, usually without painkillers. Chickens can still feel pain when they are drowned in the hot water of defeathering tanks. Nothing about the process of meat production is morally right. </p>
<h2> Vegan over vegetarian </h2>
<p> Although a vegetarian lifestyle also has benefits, it is not nearly as effective or benfecial as a vegan lifestyle. Animals are still tortured and enslaved for a human's selfish needs in both the egg and the milk industry. </p>
<p> cows only produce milk when they are pregnant to nurture their young. in the dairy industry, cows are impregnated to produce milk. Soon after birth, the calves are torn away from their mothers; the males are killed for veal and the females are raised to produce milk. once the cows are no longer useful, they are slaughtered. </p>
<p> The egg industry is just as cruel and inhumane as the egg industry. Naturally, chickens are supposed to lay only around 30 eggs annually, but through manipulation, they industry forces them to produce over 300 eggs annually.Since the chickens used for the egg industry are different from the ones used for meat, the male chicks have no use and are ground up moments after entering the world. </p>
<h2> The future is Vegan. </h2>
Even though people have been consuming meat for decades, it is no longer needed to have a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. As of 2019, only 1 million people in the worl are vegan. However, there has been a rapid increase of demand for vegan products
